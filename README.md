# Labs Repository

This repository contains weekly lab exercises, each organized by week. Each week is labeled in folders like `week_1`, `week_2`, and so on. Each folder holds all the exercises / assignments for that particular week, providing an organized way to track progress and manage content for each session.

## Overview

Each week contains a series of exercises designed to reinforce learning objectives. Exercises are grouped based on the week they were assigned, making it easy to review and find relevant materials by concepts or topic.

## Reviewer

These labs are subject to critiques and constant reviews which shall be reviewed by my technical mentor who is in the person of `Fredrick Yalley`, a Full-Stack Javascript Developer here in `Amalitech`.
